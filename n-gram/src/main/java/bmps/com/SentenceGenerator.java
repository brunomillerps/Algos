The first is an increased overall system complexity and operational load, since there is an additional fleet to monitor, manage, and scale. The availability characteristics of the cache fleet will be different from the dependent service it is acting as a cache for. The cache fleet can often be less available, for example, if it doesnâ€™t have support for zero-downtime upgrades and if it requires maintenance windows.".split(" ")

Different caching technologies have unique considerations. For example, some cache servers don't support adding nodes to a cluster without downtime, and not all cache client libraries provide consistent hashing, which is necessary to add nodes to the cache fleet and redistribute cached data. Due to the variability in client implementations of consistent hashing and the discovery of nodes in the cache fleet, we thoroughly test adding and removing cache servers before going to production.".split(" ")

                "Another decision we need to make when we evaluate different caching approaches is the choice between inline and side caches. Inline caches, or read-through/write-through caches, embed cache management into the main data access API, making cache management an implementation detail of that API. Examples include application-specific implementations like Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and standards-based implementations like HTTP caching (either with a local caching client or an external cache server like Nginx or Varnish). Side caches, in contrast, are generic object stores such as the ones provided by Amazon ElastiCache (Memcached and Redis) or libraries like Ehcache and Google Guava for in-memory caches. With side caches, the application code directly manipulates the cache before and after calls to the data source, checking for cached objects before making the downstream calls, and putting objects in the cache after those calls are completed.".split(" ")
